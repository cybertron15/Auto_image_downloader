# Auto_image_downloader
Aim of this script is to download images from google image search automatically.
the user just have to provide the search term and the script will download images from google
this script will download the images directly from the source maintaing the original image quality

THINGS TO IMPOVE:
currently the script can only download 48 images max at a time this needs to be improved.
script cannot determine the format of the image when its downloaded and by default saves it in jpeg format.
add some addtional functionality to filter the images based on its dimention and file format.
